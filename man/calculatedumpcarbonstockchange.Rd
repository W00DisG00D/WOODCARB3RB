\arguments{
\item{years}{years to calculate}

\item{totalcarbonstockchange}{Whether to return data frame of intermedate calculations or
just totals}

\item{swpSwdsNondegradable}{Percent of solid-wood products in landfills and dumps
that are not subject to decay.}

\item{paperSwdsNondegradable}{Percent of paper products in landfills and dumps that
are not subject to decay.}

\item{paperLandfillDecay}{Decay rate of paper products in landfills as a half-life in years.}

\item{swpLandfillDecay}{Decay rate of solid-wood products in landfills as a half-life in years.}

\item{swpDumpDecay}{Decay rate of solid-wood products in dumps as a half-life in years.}

\item{paperDumpDecay}{Decay rate of paper products in dumps as a half-life in years.}

\item{woodToCarbon}{Conversion factor to convert oven-dry tons of solid wood to
Tg of Carbon.}

\item{paperToCarbon}{Conversion factor to convert oven-dry tons of paper to
Tg of Carbon.}

\value{
If totalcarbonstockchange is false: a data frame of intermediate
 calculations.  If totalcarbonstockchange is true: a numeric vector of stock change
 for total carbon from dumps.
