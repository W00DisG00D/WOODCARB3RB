Default can be substituted with data with a column for each end use and row for years

Default can be substituted with data with a column for each end use and row for years
from 1900 to latest year of interest.}

\item{fsawn}{Fraction of sawnwood products that go to each end use.
Default can be substituted with data with a column for each end use and row for years
from 1900 to latest year of interest.}

\item{swpdata}{Optional argument to provide swp production and trade time series
for purposes of error analysis}
