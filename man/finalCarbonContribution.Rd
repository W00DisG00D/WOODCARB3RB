\value{
A vector of carbon contributions for all Years. Plot returned is optional
All units returned are in Thousand metric tons CO2 Equivalent.
}
\description{
Uses formulas described in WOODCARB II paper to calculate contribution contribution
with the HWP variables.
}
\details{
Decay type and half life options allow for analysis of contribution levels under
different circumstances.

The Production Approach focuses on estimating annual carbon stock change in HWP and
forests where the carbon is from trees harvested in the reporting country.

The Stock Change Approach focuses on estimating annual carbon stock change in HWP and
forests in a country regardless of wood origin.

The Atmospheric Flow Approach focuses on estimating annual carbon fluxes between
the atmosphere and forests/HWPs within a country.
