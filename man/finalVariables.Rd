\arguments{
\item{Years}{years to calculate}

\item{decaydistribution}{decay distribution to use. Defaults to exponential distribution.}

\item{halflives}{data frame of half lives to use. Must have a column associated with each
one of 13 end uses and half life values for 1900 until the maximum year of interest.}

\item{paperHL}{half life value for paper}

\item{approach}{approach to calculate corresponding final variables for.
If null, all final variables are calculated and returned.}

\item{fsp}{Fraction of structural panel products that go to each end use.
Default can be substituted with data with a column for each end use and row for years
from 1900 to latest year of interest.}

\item{fnsp}{Fraction of non-structural panel products that go to each end use.
Default can be substituted with data with a column for each end use and row for years
from 1900 to latest year of interest.}

\item{fsawn}{Fraction of sawnwood products that go to each end use.
Default can be substituted with data with a column for each end use and row for years
from 1900 to latest year of interest.}

\item{woodToCarbon}{Conversion factor to convert oven-dry tons of solid wood to
Tg of Carbon.}

\item{paperToCarbon}{Conversion factor to convert oven-dry tons of paper to
Tg of Carbon.}

\item{swpSwdsNondegradable}{Percent of solid-wood products in landfills and dumps
that are not subject to decay.}

\item{paperSwdsNondegradable}{Percent of paper products in landfills and dumps that
are not subject to decay.}

\item{swpLandfillDecay}{Decay rate of solid-wood products in landfills as a half-life in years.}

\item{paperLandfillDecay}{Decay rate of paper products in landfills as a half-life in years.}

\item{swpDumpDecay}{Decay rate of solid-wood products in dumps as a half-life in years.}

\item{paperDumpDecay}{Decay rate of paper products in dumps as a half-life in years.}

\item{swpdata}{Optional argument to provide swp production and trade time series
for purposes of error analysis}
}
\value{
If an approach is specified then only the variables needed for that
approach will be returned. If approach is null then a data frame with nine
columns (Variables 1 and 2 have two parts each) will be returned. If the decay distribution
is exponential then the data frame returned will correspond to table containing
final variables: `06 IPCC Tables` in the WOODCARB II spreadsheet.
}
\description{
Returns variables needed to calculate overall contribution.
}
\details{
All units are in Gg Carbon.

Var1A = Annual Change in stock of HWP in use form consumption

Var1B = Annual Change in stock of HWP in SWDS from consumption

Var2A = Annual Change in stock of HWP in use produced from domestic harvest

Var2B = Annual Change in stock of HWP in SWDS produced from domestic harvest

Var3 = Annual Imports of wood, paper products, wood fuel, pulp, recovered paper, roundwood/chips

Var4 = Annual Exports of wood, paper products, wood fuel, pulp, recovered paper, roundwood/chips

Var5 = Annual Domestic Harvest

Var6 = Annual release of carbon to the atmosphere from HWP consumption (from fuelwood & products
in use and products in SWDS)

Var7 = Annual release of carbon to the atmosphere from HWP (including fuelwood) where wood came from
domestic harvest (from products in use and products in SWDS)
